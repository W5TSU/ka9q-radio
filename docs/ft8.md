# Decoding FT4 and FT8 wih ka9q-radio
With a wideband front end like the RX 888, ka9q-radio makes a very
effective multiband FT4/FT8 skimmer, simultanously decoding everything
and optionally reporting spots to the crowdsourced
spotting site *http://pskreporter.info*

You can help other hams by reporting what you can hear, and possibly
get bragging rights if you hear a lot. You should especially like
seeing everything at a glance if you're a contester or DXer.

This requires four elements:
- an instance of *ka9q-radio* receiving the FT4 and FT8 segments
- an instance of *ft8-record* and *ft4-record* to record them in 15 and 7.5 second "spool" files
- one or more instances of *ft8-decode* and *ft4-decode* to read and decode
the spool files
- instances *pskreporter* to send your spots to *pskreporter.info*.

Because FT4 and FT8 use the same spooling, decoding and reporting
mechanisms, all references to ft8 in this discussion apply equally to
ft4; just substitute 'ft4' for 'ft8' in the names.

The *decode_ft8* program invoked by *ft8-decode@.service* comes from
the separate git repository *https://www.github.com/ka9q/ft8_lib*, a
fork of *https://www.github.com/kgoba/ft8_lib* by KƒÅrlis Goba with my
additions for processing spool directories. The *pskreporter* program
comes from the repository *https://www.github.com/pjsg/ftlib-pskreporter* by Philip Gladstone
N1DO, written specifically for *ka9q-radio*. You will need to build
and install these two packages separately.

If you have several antennas and instances of *ka9q-radio* you can, if
you want, decode them all with single instances of *ft8-record*,
*ft8-decode* and *pskreporter*.  This is an example of the versatility
of IP multicast. However, *ft8-record*, *ft8-decode* and *pskreporter*
communicate through files so they must run on the same system.  By
default, *ft8-record* writes its 15-second "audio" spool files to
*/var/lib/ka9q-radio/ft8* and *ft8-decode* appends decoded spots to
*/var/log/ft8.log*.

Once everything is working, you can watch your spots roll in with
```
tail -f /var/log/ft8.log
```
I encourage others to find interesting uses for this data; N1DO's *pskreporter*
is just one possibility. I'd especially like to see a local map display
that doesn't rely on Internet connectivity.


## .service files

Each element of the FT8 spotting chain runs as a Linux *systemd* job
started by a service file in */etc/systemd/system*. They are
automatically installed with "make install"
in Makefile.linux but must be enabled and started manually.
You should not have to modify them, but if you do
**beware** that they may get overwritten by a subsequent run of "make
install". The relevant files are

- radiod@.service
- ft8-record.service (and ft4-record.service)
- ft8-decode@.service (and ft4-decode@.service)
- pskreporter@.service

The '@' character in a .service file name means there can be (but
don't *have* to be) multiple instances of that service. However, you
must still specify an instance name even for a single instance.
There is only one instance each of *ft8-record* and *ft4-record* that
records all of the receiver streams (bands) on a particular multicast
channel. Each instance of *ft8-decode* and *ft4-decode* works on the
entire spool, processing files from all bands, so you can get some
parallelism by starting more.  Multiple decoders cooperate with each
other, locking spool files so each gets decoded once and deleted.  The
FT8 decoder is usually fast enough that you need only one instance to
decode all the FT8 traffic on all the bands; I wrote the spool
handling code mainly to eventually apply it to WSPR decoding, which is
much more CPU intensive.

There is one instance of *pskreporter* for each mode, ie., pskreporter@ft8,
pskreporter@ft4 or pskreporter@wspr. (WSPR is not discussed in this document;
see AI6VN's *wsprdaemon* package.)

## Configuring ft8-record and ft8-decode

To avoid clobbering a local configuration, the "make install" command
in *ka9q-radio* never writes to */etc/radio*, so you must create and
manage them manually.  (I need a better way to handle this.)

The *ft8-record* and *ft8-decode* jobs share the same configuration file
*/etc/radio/ft8-decode.conf*, which should look like this:
```
MCAST=ft8.local
DIRECTORY=/var/lib/ka9q-radio/ft8
```
This should be fairly self-explanatory; ft8.local is the domain
name of the multicast group to which *radiod* sends its received streams,
and /var/lib/ka9q-radio/ft8 is the spool directory where *ft8-receive*
records 15-second *.wav* audio files for each band and *ft8-decode* decodes
and deletes them. Any number of receive channels may share the same multicast
group and *ft8-record* will handle them all.

The output of ft8-decode is currently fixed to be /var/log/ft8.log, but this
can be changed in the ft8-decode@.service file.

Things get a litle complicated if you have multiple instances of
*radiod* receiving the same bands, e.g., from different antennas, as
they will generate spool files with the same name. This is not fully
handled yet, although in the event of a file name collision
*ft8-record* now appends a single digit to the file name just before
the *.wav* suffix to make it unique.  Alternatively, the *pcmrecord*
command used by the *ft8-record* job supports the `--prefix-source`
option to put the IP address and port number of the source on the
front of each file name, again making it unique.

The *decode_ft8* command invoked by *ft8-decode* now gets the start
time and base frequency from external file attributes placed on a
spool file by the *pcmrecord* program ("user.unixstarttime" and
"user.frequency", respectively. *decode_ft8* falls back to extracting
them from the file name only when those file attributes aren't present, so
non-standard file names should be okay as long as the file system
containing */var/lib/ka9q-radio/ft8* supports them. The main
exceptions are *vfat* and *tmpfs* so don't use them for the spool. Use
a regular Linux file system; all the modern ones (eg, XFS, ext4)
support them.

## Enabling and starting ft8-record and ft8-decode

This is very simple; just say
```
sudo enable ft8-record ft4-record ft8-decode@1 ft4-decode@1
sudo start ft8-record ft4-record ft8-decode@1 ft4-decode@1
```
Again, notice that the record jobs need only one instance so you need
not append a *@n* suffix. This is necessary for the decode jobs even if
you only want one of each. 
If you want multiple instances of a decoder, just add them like this:
```
sudo enable ft8-decode@2 ft8-decode@3 ...
sudo start ft8-decode@2 ft8-decode@3 ...
```
though this really shouldn't be necessary unless a large backlog
has built in a spool directory because the recorder kept running
while the decoder was stopped.

## Configuring *ka9q-radio* to receive FT4 and FT8

You can use my own configuration files as a guide; they're available
in *config/radiod@ka9q-hf.conf.d*. (I've split my radiod configuration
into separate files in a directory to make them
easier to manage. *radiod* concatenates them into a single temp file and reads them.
You can still use a unified .conf file if you like.) The file ft8.conf in that directory lists the HF FT8
channels I am currently receiving. Note that most of the sampling
rates and bandwidths are larger than the usual 12 kHz and 3 kHz
respectively; this takes in enough of each band to capture the DX
fox/hound segments that are usually above the standard ranges.
The sample rates are passed to the decoder through the sample rate 
field in the *.wav* file header; I have modified *decode_ft8* to handle them.
For example, on 20 meters I look for FT8 signals anywhere from 14.0711 MHz to 14.102 MHz,
and on 40 meters from 7.0561 to 7.087 MHz:
```
[ft8-40-20m]
data = ft8.local
samprate = 64k
encoding = s16be
mode = usb
hang-time = 0
recovery-rate = 60
low = 100
high = 31k
freq = "7056k 14m071"
```

If you like, you could actually look for FT8 in an entire band; it
might be interesting to see what you find.
