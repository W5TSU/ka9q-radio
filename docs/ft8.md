# Decoding FT4 and FT8 with ka9q-radio
With a wideband front end like the RX 888, *ka9q-radio* makes a very
effective multiband FT4/FT8 skimmer, simultanously decoding and
reporting everything to the crowdsourced spotting site
*http://pskreporter.info*.

You can help other hams by reporting what you hear, and possibly get
bragging rights. You should especially like seeing every band at a
glance if you're a contester or DXer.

This requires four elements:
- an instance of *ka9q-radio* receiving the FT4 and FT8 segments
- an instance of *ft8-record* and *ft4-record* to record them in 15 and 7.5 second "spool" files
- one or more instances of *ft8-decode* and *ft4-decode* to read and decode
the spool files
- instances of *pskreporter* to send your spots to *http://pskreporter.info*.

Because FT4 and FT8 use the same spooling, decoding and reporting
mechanisms, all references to ft8 in the following discussion apply equally to
ft4; just substitute 'ft4' for 'ft8'.

The *decode_ft8* program invoked by **ft8-decode@.service** comes from
the separate git repository *https://www.github.com/ka9q/ft8_lib*, a
fork of *https://www.github.com/kgoba/ft8_lib* by KƒÅrlis Goba with my
additions for processing spool directories. By default it looks for FT8;
the -4 option tells it to look for FT4.

The *pskreporter* program comes from the repository
*https://www.github.com/pjsg/ftlib-pskreporter* by Philip Gladstone
N1DO, written specifically for *ka9q-radio*. You will need to build
and install these two packages separately.

If you have several antennas and instances of *ka9q-radio* you can, if
you want, decode them all with single instances of *ft8-record*,
*ft8-decode* and *pskreporter*.  This is an example of the versatility
of IP multicast. However, *ft8-record*, *ft8-decode* and *pskreporter*
communicate through files so they must run on the same system.  By
default, *ft8-record* writes its 15-second "audio" spool files to
**/var/lib/ka9q-radio/ft8** and *ft8-decode* appends decoded spots to
**/var/log/ft8.log**.

Once everything is working, you can watch your spots roll in with
```
tail -f /var/log/ft8.log
```
I encourage others to find interesting uses for this data; N1DO's *pskreporter*
is just one possibility. I'd especially like to see a local map display
that doesn't rely on Internet connectivity.


## .service files

Each element of the FT8 spotting chain runs as a Linux *systemd* job
started by a service file in **/etc/systemd/system**. They are
automatically installed with `make install`
in **Makefile.linux* but must be enabled and started manually.
You should not have to modify them, but if you do
**beware** that they may get overwritten by a subsequent run of `make
install`. The relevant files are

- **radiod@.service**
- **ft8-record.service** (and **ft4-record.service**)
- **ft8-decode@.service** (and **ft4-decode@.service**)
- **pskreporter@.service**

A '@' character in a **.service** file name means there can be (but
don't *have* to be) multiple instances of that service. However, you
must still specify an instance name even for a single instance.  There
is only one instance each of *ft8-record* and *ft4-record* that
records all of the receiver streams (bands) on a particular multicast
channel, which can be used for output by one or more *radiod* instances.  Each
instance of *ft8-decode* and *ft4-decode* works on the same directory
processing files from all bands, so you can get some parallelism by
starting more. (FT8 and FT4 must use different spool directories
because there's no other way to tell the decoder which to decode.)
Multiple decoders use file locking so each file gets decoded once and
deleted.  The FT8 decoder is usually fast enough that you need only
one instance to decode every band; I wrote
the spool handling code mainly to eventually apply it to WSPR
decoding, which is much more CPU intensive.

There is one instance of *pskreporter* for each mode, i.e.,
*pskreporter@ft8*, *pskreporter@ft4* or *pskreporter@wspr*. (WSPR is not
discussed in this document; see *http://github.com/rrobinett/wsprdaemon*.)

## Configuring *ft8-record* and *ft8-decode*

To avoid clobbering a local configuration, the `make install` command
in *ka9q-radio* never writes to **/etc/radio**, so you must create and
manage them manually.  (I need a better way to handle this.)

The *ft8-record* and *ft8-decode* jobs share the same configuration file
**/etc/radio/ft8-decode.conf**, which should look like this:
```
MCAST=ft8.local
DIRECTORY=/var/lib/ka9q-radio/ft8
```
This should be fairly self-explanatory; **ft8.local** is the domain
name of the multicast group to which *radiod* sends its received streams,
and **/var/lib/ka9q-radio/ft8** is the spool directory where *ft8-receive*
writes 15-second **wav**-format audio files for each band and *ft8-decode* reads, decodes
and deletes them. Any number of *radiod* instances and channels may send to the
same multicast group and *ft8-record* will handle them all.

The output of *ft8-decode* is appended to **/var/log/ft8.log**, but this
can be changed in **ft8-decode@.service**.

If multiple instances of *radiod*
receive the same channels, e.g., from different antennas, their
spool files would ordinarily have the same name. If this happens *ft8-record*
appends a single digit to the file name just before the **.wav** suffix
to try to make it unique.  Alternatively, **ft8-record.service** can
be changed to pass the `--prefix-source` option to the *pcmrecord*
command to prefix each file name with the IP address and port number
of the source computer, again making them unique.

The *pcmrecord* command used by *ft8-record* has long placed several
external file attributes on the files it creates.  The *decode_ft8*
command invoked by *ft8-decode* now uses two of them,
**user.unixstarttime** and **user.frequency**, to specify the starting
timestamp and base frequency.  Otherwise it falls back to extracting
them from the file name as before, so any non-standard file names
needed to resolve collisions are okay as long as the file system
containing **/var/lib/ka9q-radio/ft8** supports extended attributes. The
main exceptions are *vfat* and *tmpfs*, but most other modern Linux
filesystems like *XFS* and *ext4* do support them.

## Enabling and starting *ft8-record* and *ft8-decode*

This is very simple; just say
```
sudo enable ft8-record ft4-record ft8-decode@1 ft4-decode@1
sudo start ft8-record ft4-record ft8-decode@1 ft4-decode@1
```
Again, notice that the record jobs are not multi-instance so you need
not append a **@n** suffix. Suffixes are necessary for the decode jobs even if
you only want one of each. 
If you want multiple instances of a decoder, just add them like this:
```
sudo enable ft8-decode@2 ft8-decode@3 ...
sudo start ft8-decode@2 ft8-decode@3 ...
```
though this really shouldn't be necessary unless a large backlog
has built in a spool directory because the recorder kept running
while the decoder was stopped.

## Configuring *ka9q-radio* to receive FT4 and FT8

You can use my own configuration files as a guide; they're available
in **config/radiod@ka9q-hf.conf.d**. (I've split my radiod configuration
into separate files in a directory to make them
easier to manage. *radiod* concatenates them into a single temp file and reads them.
You can still use a unified **radiod@name.conf** file if you like.) The file
**radiod@ka9q-hf.conf.d/ft8.conf** lists the HF FT8
channels I am currently receiving. Note that most of the sample
rates and bandwidths are wider than the usual 12 kHz and 3 kHz
respectively; this takes in enough of each band to capture the DX
fox/hound segments that are usually above the standard ranges.
The sample rates are passed to the decoder through the sample rate 
field in the **.wav** file header; I have modified *decode_ft8* to handle them.
For example, on 20 meters I look for FT8 signals anywhere from 14.0711 MHz to 14.102 MHz,
and on 40 meters from 7.0561 MHz to 7.087 MHz:
```
[ft8-40-20m]
data = ft8.local
samprate = 64k
encoding = s16be
mode = usb
hang-time = 0
recovery-rate = 60
low = 100
high = 31k
freq = "7056k 14m071"
```

If you like, you could actually look for FT8 in an entire band; it
might be interesting to see what you find.
